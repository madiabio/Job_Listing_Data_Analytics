## Findings
## 1) What are the findings of your data analytics for the above sections?
The job data had a large number of samples but a relatively small date range. It consisted of 318,477 listings with unique IDs. There were 168065 different job titles for 65 different locations. 30 job classifications and 338 sub-classifications were represented. Only 163 dates were included in the data. It was hypothesised that there would be a large number of jobs in bigger cities, that IT would be the dominant industry for high wages and availability, and that the sector would also have the largest growth rate. The hypothesis was validated for everything except for the growth rate, where other top sectors grew similarly. It was impossible to extract useful predictions using predictive analysis methods due to the lack of job data over a prolonged period and also strange patterns of listing frequency observed as the holiday season approached. Thus, extensive predictive analysis beyond the moving averages were not included in this as it was deemed as adding little to no value to the overall analysis of this dataset.

Based on job market size and wages, the best cities to live in were Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and ACT. The city with the largest job market was Sydney, followed by Melbourne and Brisbane. The market size of Brisbane, despite being the third largest job market, was less than half the size of Sydney's market. The highest upper quartile of the lowest salary component of a listing in the country was offered in the ACT, but it ranked 6th for job market and was close to a tie with Adelaide. Despite Sydney and Melbourne being much larger cities, the distributions of lower salaries were the same across Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. Since Brisbane still accounts for 10.88% of all job listings, it may be a preferred city to live in to optimize cost of living to wages.

On the other hand, some of the worst places to live in according to these factors were the Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast and the Morning Peninsula & Bass Coast, potentially due to their status as holiday destinations. There were much fewer job listings in these cities and the distribution of wages skewed significantly lower, as Hospitality & Tourism tended to be the dominant sector. Interestingly, each of these cities are close to either Brisbane or Melbourne, but do not seem to benefit the average worker from the prosperity of the nearby cities. 

The best sector to work in if one wanted the opportunity to live in many places was by far Healthcare & Medical, where IT, Education & Training and Manufacturing, Transport & Logistics were the worst. Healthcare & Medical was the biggest sector in 52.3% of cities represented in the data.  Hospitality & Tourism was the second most represented sector for this metric, ranking very close to Mining, Resources & Energy. IT was the biggest sector in only 4 cities: Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and the ACT. This is despite IT having the largest market size of every sector and some of the highest wages available.

IT was the best sector for opportunities and job options based on the number of listings and the distributions of average salaries, with Programming Languages and Cloud Technologies being some of the most valubale skills to learn in terms of job opportunities. Developers/Programmers were the most popular sub-sector of IT, but Programme & Project Management and Architects had the best average salary distributions.

## Recommended actions for balancing the market
## 2) What actions for balancing the market do you suggest based on your findings?

To balance the job market, several actions can be suggested based on the findings. First, addressing the disparity in job availability and wages across different regions and sectors is crucial. Efforts should be made to incentivize the creation of more high-paying jobs in smaller markets like Adelaide and the ACT, potentially by providing subsidies or tax breaks to companies willing to establish operations there. Additionally, improving access to training and education in high-demand skills such as IT and healthcare in these regions can help workers transition to better-paying jobs, thereby reducing regional economic disparities.

Moreover, there is a need to support the sectors that have the highest demand and growth potential. Since IT and Healthcare & Medical are among the top sectors with high wages and job listings, investing in these sectors can create more employment opportunities and enhance economic growth. Additionally, there was a large demand for Trades & Services jobs, and raising wages in this sector could potentially help to balance the demand. These improvements can be achieved through government and private sector partnerships to fund skill development programs, innovation hubs, and research facilities. Finally, enhancing the infrastructure and connectivity in smaller cities and rural areas can attract more businesses to set up operations outside the major urban centers, thus promoting balanced regional development and reducing the concentration of jobs in cities like Sydney and Melbourne.


## Recommendations for future refinement of this analysis
## 3) How could you refine your data analysis?

To refine the data analysis, one could start by including job listing data over a longer period of time. This would allow for better analysis of market trends and also offer a much better platform to perform seasonal analysis and forecasting on. The data given was from 2018, and many sectors such as IT may have experienced many changes since then. Therefore, to provide a better analysis of the current market, it would make sense for the job data to have been collected from the present day, as 2018 was well before major global events such as COVID-19 and the popularisation of consumer generative AI/Machine Learning technologies such as ChatGPT, which may have caused signifcant changes to the market. Additionally, integrating data from industry reports, economic forecasts, and labor market surveys would offer deeper insights into sector trends and future job demand. 

Another way to enhance the analysis would be by selecting different parameters and employing more advanced analytical techniques. Instead of only focusing on the categories given, parameters such as job satisfaction ratings, turnover rates, and company growth potential could be included. Techniques like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and more advanced natural language processing methods could be used to determine career progression opportunities, job satisfaction, and to identify good employers. Using some form of standardized skill term list, potentially scraped from other sources such as LinkedIn, could be beneficial in reducing the bias introduced by using chatGPT to generate the skill term list and skill categories.


## Implications of these findings for employers and employees
## 4) Are there any implications for employers and employees based on the findings you obtained? Justify your answer.

The findings suggest several implications for both employers and employees. For employers, the data highlights the need to address regional disparities in job availability and wages. Companies may benefit from expanding operations to smaller markets like Adelaide and the ACT, where incentives such as tax breaks or subsidies could make this expansion financially viable. Additionally, employers in high-demand sectors such as IT and healthcare should consider investing in training and development programs to build a skilled workforce, which can help address the skills gap and enhance their competitiveness. 

For employees, the analysis indicates that cities like Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and the ACT offer the best opportunities in terms of job market size and wages. Workers in sectors such as Healthcare & Medical and IT are likely to find more job openings and higher wages in these locations. Trades & Services was a very in demand sector, but wages were not reflective of this. Employees should focus on acquiring skills in high-demand categories, such as Programming Languages and Cloud Technologies for IT professionals, to improve their employability and potential earnings. Those in regions with fewer job listings and lower wages might consider relocating to larger markets or investing in skill development to transition into higher-paying sectors.
